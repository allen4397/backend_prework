A method creates a function that is repeatable and saves time and lines of code by just taking the variables without requiring the user to type the entire function every time the method would be used.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

def hello
  p "Sam I am"
end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

def hello_someone(name)
  p "#{name} I am"
end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("John")
